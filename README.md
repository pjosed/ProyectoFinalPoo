# 🐱 MrMicrofost — Gamified Learning Against Digital Threats  
### 📘 Published in *OnBoard Knowledge Journal (2025)*

CyberCat is a **decision-based educational game** where you help a cat survive digital threats by choosing the healthiest responses to real cybersecurity scenarios.

---

## 🚀 About the Project
Mr. Microfost teaches users about **cyber addiction, spoofing, phishing, grooming**, and other digital risks — but *not* through boring quizzes.

Instead, you interact with a small cat whose **HP bar increases or decreases** based on the quality of your decisions across **5 different situations**.

No strict right or wrong — just *better or worse decisions*, like real life.

### 👾 Goal  
Keep the cat alive and achieve the best score through all 5 scenarios.

---

## 🧩 Mechanics
- Each scenario presents a cybersecurity-related situation.  
- You choose one of the available responses.  
- The cat reacts and its HP bar changes based on how healthy the decision is.  
- After finishing all scenarios, your score is saved into a **high-score list**.

### 📈 Replayability  
Every playthrough provides feedback so users progressively learn from their choices.
